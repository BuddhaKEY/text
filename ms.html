The answer is it should be ______ different. The whole point of paraphrasing is to show you have read and understood another person's ideas and can summarise them in your own writing style rather than borrowing their phrases. If you just change a few words or add some bits ______ to an otherwise reproduced passage, you will probably ______ for plagiarism. You should aim to ______ and simplify a writer's ideas and describe them using different sentence structures and expressions. It is also important to credit the original writer by referencing.",
